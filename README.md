## Sinatra Project - Flatiron School.

Let's face it, music is all around us all the time. Whether you're a musician or someone who only listens to music when they're at the supermarket, everybody has favorite songs. But who can remember all of them? 

This was the inspiration for my project. Golden Songbook keeps track of a user's favorites songs with the option to add, edit and delete songs from their songbook. Users are able to view other user's songs however, they are only able to edit and delete their own. It's as easy as signing up and creating an account today.

Golden Songbook remembers so you don't forget!
